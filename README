Config file:
Format: Json

The command list format is as follows:
commandlist: [ { command }, { command } ]
command : { probability: int, iterations: int, sequence: [ { request }, { request } ]
request: { url: string, content-type: string, method: string, post-data: string*, resp: string**, func: []string*** }
* post-data: the data that will be included in the body of the post request (will be ignored if method = GET)
Format: "{ example: 1, example2: "blah" }" (Assuming it's json)
* resp: How the response will look (If the response does not look like this, it will be ignored. So basically if this is an empty string or if it's left out of the sequence, it will ignore all responses.)
Format: --var is the 'variable' that the value will be stored in, think grok {STRING:var}
string = #{str(var)} //Greedy
int = #{int(var)}
list = []var, or if you want a statically sized list, [int, int, string]var -- (var[0], var[1], var[2])
json: {}var -- ex: {str(var):string, str(var2):int}var1 -- var1.var = the str. Or if you want to use a static json setup: { str("response-time":respvar):int } -- var1.respvar = the int
Can set as a global variable with global(str(var)), else it will only be used for the context of the next call.
